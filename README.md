# AI Test Case Generator (Mock Version)

## Description

This is a full-stack mock application that simulates generating automated test cases from code files. It has:

- A **Node.js + Express** backend that handles API requests (mock implementation without real AI API calls).
- A **React + Vite** frontend to upload files and display generated test cases.

> ⚠️ Note: The AI functionality is mocked because real AI API access requires paid keys.

## Features

- Upload your source code files through the frontend.
- Simulated test case generation (mocked responses).
- Backend API built with Express.
- Frontend built with React and Vite.
- Uses `concurrently` to run backend and frontend together.
